 located in a factory in blueberry, next, the leader must stand at the planing table, while other 4 players, must stand at a role point,
 for exemple, if you want to be a driver, stand in the checkpoint that says "driver" and so on, then the leader of the crew must start the robbery by using /rpanel, then chose "bank robbery"
 after that, the team must head to the bank, the hacker will hack the storage door (/decrypt), then the detonator will blow up the safe door (/blowup), then the robber must get in the safe, and use (/robbank) on all the four checkpoints inside the safe,
 after that, the crew must return to the driver, the driver must be in a car, when all the team enters in the car, the driver should deliver the car to the robbery hideout, park it inside (in a checkpoint in the corner) then type /rveh, the money will be devided evenly
